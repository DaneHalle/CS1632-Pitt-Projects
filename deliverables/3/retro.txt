Selenium IDE is a useful and powerful tool. However, it is plagued with bugs and issues that made it difficult to use in an effective manner. There is time save in using this IDE as opposed to writing everything yourself but we often found debugging to be a time consuming aspect of this project. One part that was quite annoying was attempting to fulfill the FUN-WELCOME requirement with a test. Often times it would say that x text did not equal y text even though x and y were the same thing. We did enjoy the IDE when it worked. Being able to record actions was quite nice in testing a lot as well as figuring out commands we otherwise did not know how to use.
